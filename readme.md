# sass-tooltips

**A portable Sass-based approach for simple text tooltips on arbitrary HTML elements.**

Install via `npm` (or `yarn` if that's your thing):

```
npm install --save-dev @tomodomo/sass-tooltips
```

## Usage

`sass-tooltips` is [eyeglass](https://github.com/sass-eyeglass/eyeglass)-aware. If you're using it, simply import withâ€¦

```scss
@import "sass-tooltips";
```

Otherwise, something like this should work:

```scss
@import "path/to/node_modules/@tomodomo/sass-tooltips/sass";
```

Then, in your HTML, add `data-tip-[direction]="Tooltip content here"` to the element you would like the tooltip targeted at, where `[direction]` is one of `tl`, `tm`, `tr`, `bl`, `bm`, or `br` (an abbreviation for top/bottom, left/middle/right). This corresponds to the direction the tooltip arrow is pointing.

For example:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/vanpattenmedia/vpm-tooltips" data-tip-tm="What an awesome tooltip library!">VPM Tooltips</a>
```

You can see how each direction is rendered in the screenshot below:

## Options

The library can be customised with a number of variables. The variables, and their default values, are as follows:

```sass
$sass-tooltip--background: black;
$sass-tooltip--text-color: white;

$sass-tooltip--font-family: inherit;
$sass-tooltip--font-size: inherit;
$sass-tooltip--text-shadow: none;

$sass-tooltip--arrow-width: 0.875em;
$sass-tooltip--arrow-height: 0.6em;

$sass-tooltip--border-radius: 2px;
$sass-tooltip--padding: 0.45em 0.75em;
$sass-tooltip--z-index: 99;
```

## Caveats

The library makes use of `calc()`, and thus [will not work in IE8, Opera Mini, or earlier Android browsers](http://caniuse.com/calc). (A pull request that safely eliminates the `calc()` requirement would be [happily accepted](https://github.com/vanpattenmedia/vpm-tooltips/pulls)!)

Placing your tooltip text in the data attribute alone is _not sufficient for accessibility_. You might wish to set an `aria-label` attribute on your element, or use another recommended best practice to make sure you're accomomdating all users.

## Acknowledgements

This method of inserting tooltips was inspired by the [Daniel-Hug/tooltips](https://github.com/Daniel-Hug/tooltips) library.
